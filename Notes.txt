Questions:

timing:
what is MB in the print statement?

do we time everything in the fnction?

rand programs:
do both rand programs take 2 arguments? (X and blocksize)

when calculating average, do we calculate it for each block then get an
average for all of the blocks?



Answers:

calculating average and max for sequential requires connecting the blocks
-not for random reads
*solution: add argument current_id to get_calculation use that to continue foe
sequential reads
-also get_calculation returns int that is current_id

cannot use fflush

for timing writes, time reading the csv as well
